                     <h1>AFABL Programmer Study</h1>
                     <p>I am integrating reinforcement learning into a Scala-embedded domain-specific language (DSL). This language, which I call AFABL (A Friendly Adaptive Behavior Language), makes it possible to create intelligent software agents using elements of the reinforcement learning model. I claim that writing particular kinds of intelligent software agents is easier in AFABL than in traditional programming languages and that AFABL agents are easier to adapt to new environments. Scientifically supporting these claims is the final piece of my doctoral dissertation in computer science at Georgia Tech. I would be honored to have your help in completing a study in which you (anonymously) write a series of intelligent software agents in Scala and AFABL which I will analyze to support the claims in my dissertation. If you provide your email address here we will notify you when the study is ready and provide more details. Providing your email does not imply any commitment on your part and your email address be be used only to notify you when the study is ready.</p>

                     <p>Thank you!</p>
